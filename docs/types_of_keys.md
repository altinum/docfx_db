## Selecting a key

### By the number of columns involved

**Composite Key**:

- A key that consists of two or more columns used together to identify a record uniquely.
- Useful when a single column is insufficient to ensure uniqueness.

**Simple Key**: 

A simple key, on the other hand, is a single column that uniquely identifies a record. It does not rely on additional columns for uniqueness. For example, a single employee ID or a single ISBN for a book could serve as a simple key.

### By the origin of the key

**Natural Key**:

- A key formed from attributes that naturally exist in the real world and are used to uniquely identify records (e.g., Social Security Number, email address).
- Unlike surrogate keys, natural keys carry meaning in the business context.

**Surrogate Key**:

- An artificial key (usually a number) that is created to uniquely identify a record when a natural key is not suitable. 
- Surrogate keys are not derived from any actual data in the business context. They are usually generated by the database management system.

Common Examples of Natural Keys:

- Social Security Number (SSN)
- Email Address
- National Identification Number (OIB in Croatia)
- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
- ISBN (International Standard Book Number)
- Phone Number
- Employee ID
- Account Number
- Product Code or SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
- Passport Number

Common Examples of Surrogate Keys:

- **Auto-Incremented Integer**: Many databases support auto-incrementing integer columns that automatically generate a unique integer value for each new record. For instance, a table of employees might have an `EmployeeID` column that starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each new employee.
- **UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)**: Some systems use UUIDs as surrogate keys. These are 128-bit values that are generated to be globally unique. For example, a table could have a column called `UserID` that contains UUIDs like `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Natural Keys:

- **Advantages**:
  - **Meaningful**: Natural keys often have real-world significance, making it easier for users to understand the data.
  - **Built-in Uniqueness**: If properly maintained, natural keys are unique, which helps in ensuring data integrity.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Changes Over Time**: Natural keys can change (e.g., a name change or email address update), which can complicate updates in related tables.
  - **Complexity**: Some natural keys, like composite natural keys, can be complex and harder to manage.

### With the eye of a mathematician

**Super Keys:**

All the column combinations that are eligible to be used as a key. A trivial solution is including all the columns in the key. The set of Super Keys include all the mathematically correct combinations. 

**Candidate Key**:

- A column or set of columns that can uniquely identify a record in a table.
- A minimal Super Key: any of the columns dropped makes it unsuitable to be used as a key
- There can be multiple candidate keys in a table, but one is selected as the **primary key**.
- All candidate keys must be unique and not contain NULL values.

As an example both **EAN** (European Article Number) and **ISBN** (International Standard Book Number) can serve as candidate keys in a relational database context. These to can be converted to one an other.

**Primary Key**:

- A unique identifier for each record in a table.
- Cannot contain NULL values.
- Each table can have only one primary key, which may consist of a single column or a combination of multiple columns (composite key).

**Alternate Key**:

- Any candidate key that is not selected as the primary key.
- Serves as a potential alternate means of uniquely identifying records.
